# OpenCASCADE-hs

![OpenCASCADE-hs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joe-warren/opencascade-hs/main/images/logo/opencascade-hs-logo-name.svg)

A third party Haskell wrapper to [Open CASCADE](https://dev.opencascade.org) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Cascade_Technology)), which is the underlying framework behind [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/).

The API is only partially complete, and largely consists of the modeling functionality (BRep/Boolean Ops/Curves/etc), ignoring the visualization components. 

## Dependencies 

You'll need the main OpenCASCADE libraries/header files installed to use this.

Please see the [main readme](https://github.com/joe-warren/opencascade-hs/#installing-dependencies) on Github for more information.
