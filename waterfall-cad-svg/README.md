# Waterfall CAD SVG

![Waterfall CAD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joe-warren/opencascade-hs/main/images/logo/waterfall-cad-logo-name.svg)

This package provides SVG support for Waterfall-CAD.

Waterfall CAD is a declarative CAD/Solid Modeling library.

This uses [opencascade-hs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/opencascade-hs) as the kernel, but provides a "more functional" API over it.

## Dependencies 

You'll need the main OpenCASCADE libraries/header files installed to use this.

Please see the [main readme](https://github.com/joe-warren/opencascade-hs/#installing-dependencies) on Github for more information.

## Examples

There are examples of how to use the library in [waterfall-cad-examples](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/waterfall-cad-examples).

You can see images of these examples in the [main readme](https://github.com/joe-warren/opencascade-hs/#examples) on Github.
